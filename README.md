## Description
- REST API following Clean Architecture & Domain-Driven Design principles
- Use .NET 7, EF Core, and common patterns such as CQRS, unit of work, repository, mediator, and more 💪🏽
- Use some awesome open-source libraries such as MediatR, FluentValidation, ErrorOr, Throw, Mapster, and more.
- The developing environment will be visual studio code & dotnet CLI only. We will use awesome vscode plugins for everything from sending HTTP requests to connecting to our SQL database, debugging, and peeking at JWT tokens.
